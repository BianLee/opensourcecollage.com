<br/>Over the course of my high school years, I've gotten to work in numerous school clubs and regional organizations, most of which were nonprofits that were all founded by my peers. I soon came to realize how similar these organizations were, in terms of the events they host, and the general aim of the group. There were too many new nonprofits forming that all shared the goal of solving the education system, through tutoring, research, whatever means it may be. While a handful of them seemed to know what they were doing and had pretty impressive accomplishments, too many of the so-called "nonprofits" were nothing more than fancy board titles and pretty Instagram promotions. It has become too difficult to find meaningful organizations amidst all the other useless groups. It's easy for anyone to sign up to be in one of these groups and claim their leadership ability through these board positions, yet it is difficult to tell whether they achieved anything notable from it. To me, it seemed like students could easily waste time on useless extracurriculars doing useless things that really benefit no one. To address these issues, I built Open Source Collage.

<br/>Around February, I began prototyping the model. I also got my brother Ian and my friend Pranav to help with the development of the project. Pranav and I wrote codes (primarily in Javascript), and I had my brother handle the logistical side. After working on it for a while, we released the project some time around the end of March. The main functionality was allowing users to browse events and extracurricular opportunities, and if they signed up for an account, they could share their own as well. We entered our project in a business ideathon competition, where the project placed 3rd, winning a small monetary fund and mentorship from a business consultant.

<br/>I had written the code not long after learning ReactJS and MERN stack for the first time, and with poor design and repetitive lines the codebase soon became unmanageable with a jumble of spaghetti codes. The app didn’t have anything special either; there wasn’t any unique functionality that another similar website didn’t have. I realized there wasn’t much potential. I quickly lost the motivation to continue on with the project, and I moved on to doing other things, leaving Open Source Collage at an announced hiatus.

<br/>I would have abandoned the project entirely if it hadn’t been for some business classes I was taking over the summer. I was inspired to create something on my own, and manage it. I wanted to get back into the fun of developing web applications, and I decided I would pursue this platform again, this time with all seriousness. I had not gotten far last time, and I decided I would change things up a little bit this time. While it’s great to have a feature in which users could browse or share events and extracurriculars, there were too many similar websites that accomplished the same functionality far better than what I had implemented. I also realized that for my application to succeed, I should focus on content possibly even more so than the technicality. As an amateur developer, the code is admittedly pretty bad, and there is a limit to what I can accomplish through code. Yet, even if it follows horrible software design and has a bad interface, users could still return and continue using the site, if the content is worth the bad user experience. This is probably how Hacker News is so popular among tech nerds, and 4chan attracts millions of homeschool kids.

<br/>I didn’t want Open Source Collage to be completely different from what it was previously, so I thought to turn it into an educational platform. Essentially, it would be a web space where high school students could learn new materials, test their knowledge, discover new interests, find organizations, and read blogs like this for advice and entertainment. Having taken numerous classes at high school and from dual enrollment program, I had enough notes and question sets to use. I developed the quiz function independently one weekend, then I later integrated it into the rest of the newly built site. I ensured that the new layout was mobile-friendly and responsive on all devices. After making improvements to every existing feature, I was able to release this project on August 8th.
