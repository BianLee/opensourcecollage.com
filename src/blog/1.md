<br/>Over the course of my high school years, I've gotten to work in numerous school clubs and regional organizations, most of which were nonprofits that were all founded by my peers. I soon came to realize how <i>similar</i> these organizations were, in terms of the events they host, and the general aim of the group. There were too many new nonprofits forming that all shared the goal of solving the education system, through tutoring, research, whatever means it may be. While handful of them seemed to know what they were doing and had pretty impressive accomplishments, too many of the so called "nonprofits" were nothing more than fancy board titles and pretty Instagram promotions. It has become too difficult to find meaningful organizations admist all the other useless groups. It's easy for anyone to sign up to be in one of these groups and claim their leadership ability through these board positions, yet it is difficult to tell whether they achieved anything notable from it. To me, it seemed like students could easily waste time on useless extracurriculars doing useless things that really benefits no one. To address these issues, I built Open Source Collage.

<br/> Around February, I began prototyping the model. I also got my friend Pranav to help with the development of the project. We wrote codes primarily in Javascript, and once ready, we released the project. Looking back, I can't really call the original site an actual "app"; it wasn't much besides a simple mechanism to store and retreieve things from the database. The main functionality was allowing users to browse events and extracurricular opportunities, and if they sign up for an account, they could share their own also. Because I wrote the code not after learning ReactJS and MERN stack for the first time, the codebase soon became unmanageable. It was a jumble of spaghetti code.
