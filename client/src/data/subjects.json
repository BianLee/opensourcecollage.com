The problems test knowledge in understanding of basic terms, in different topics such as accounting, administration, economics, finance, management, marketing, etc. While it's unlikley that you'd use this to study for a quiz or an exam, it's always good to have foundational knowledge in different subjects, especially in practical fields like business.",

    "description": "This quiz covers fundamental concepts in computer networking. To learn networking, it's helpful to have knowledge in computing & IT, since many concepts are quite obscure and complex. It is even more helpful to learn by testing things out physically, instead of reading over notes and simply doing practice problems. For that matter, Cisco's Packet Tracer is highly recommended, as it allows simulation of networks. Topics on this quiz include topology, TCP/IP, OSI model, ports, sockets, DNS, and more.",
