It should be used to review understanding of terms, and how well you can recall them. Topics include: Celestial sphere, sky motions, solar & lunar movements, origins of astronomy, notable scientists and figures, periodic motions, electromagnetic spectrum, telescopes, planets in the solar system, composition of the planets, and more.

In some locations, early cultures assembled massive artifacts that possibly had some astronomical purpose. In addition to their ceremonial uses, these observatories could be employed to determine the seasons, an important factor in knowing when to plant crops and in understanding the length of the year.",
