<br/>As a high school senior, I can now look back at the past three years and think of all the good (and some poor) decisions I’ve made that shaped the person I am today. I will eventually discuss most of those at some point in the future on these blogs (so you can take some advice and make better choices yourself if you are still an underclassmen). Today I’ll start with what I think is the most impactful decision I made in high school. Of course, I have another whole year ahead, and who knows how I’ll change by the time I graduate. Maybe the “best decision” is yet to come -- I can only hope.

<br/>But as far as what’s happened up to this point, I can say, without a doubt, that the best decision I made was joining our high school’s Cybersecurity Club in my sophomore year. The passion and involvement I had within this club surpasses many other clubs and organizations I’ve been part of. The experiences I gained from the club have helped me better understand what drives me and what I’m truly passionate about. I also feel like I made the most friends in the club. In fact, Pranav, who contributed to the development of Open Source Collage back in March (for initial release), is a friend whom I got to know from having been on the same team in cybersecurity competitions. The club has definitely opened the door for me to get to know more people and build connections with peers that are all passionate about similar things. While “cybersecurity club” may not be as distinguished and well known as other clubs such as debate or science olympiads (which are all universally recognized in high schools all across the board), I still think I got the most value out of it. This blog is all about finding the right group of people, and focusing on your passions. Hopefully you can also find a school club that you know you truly belong in, where you can dedicate time into learning while having fun.

<br/>I joined the club the year it was founded at my school (my sophomore year). It had two co-founders, Sydney and Brian, and it was from Sydney I first heard about the club (since she was a section leader of our cello section). She later told me that they had tried to establish the club the year prior, yet faced rejection (due to some unfortunate misconception by the ASB that “cybersecurity is the same as computer science”). They then had to prove how unique the club really is, and it was finally approved the next semester. I wasn’t really part of any other clubs at the time, so I decided I would join the meetings and see what cybersecurity is all about.

<br/>Believe it or not, despite now identifying myself as a pretty “tech-savvy” person, I didn’t know anything about computers nor coding in the beginning of my sophomore year. I don’t think I was even familiar with the term “cybersecurity.” My interest back then was far from learning how computers functioned. That soon changed once I joined the club to go to meetings and learn different things myself over time.

<br/>We all know club meetings during school hours are useless. All the exciting things happen outside the school. For speech and debate, this would be debate tournaments, for Model UN, it would be Saturday conferences. With Cybersecurity Club, it was participating in CyberPatriot, a nation-wide competition in which teams are tasked to find vulnerabilities in operating systems and secure them for points. The competition took place at a local community college (location doesn’t matter as long as teams can get together and have access to the target machines) and teams would work together within a six-hour window to gain as many points. There are three operating systems to be secured (Windows, Windows Server and Linux) as well as tasks on Cisco’s Packet Tracer (computer networking). The work would be divided among team members, and each person would specialize in a single task.
